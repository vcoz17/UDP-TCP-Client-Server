# UDP-TCP-Client-Server

This is an implementation of a TCP and UDP client server program in which the server acts as a (simple) calculator to act on two numbers sent to it by the client.

The server performs the Operation Code (OC) requested on the two integer numbers it receives from the sender and returns the result.

The client sends an Operation Code (OC), and the two numbers it has acquired from the user. OC can be: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
